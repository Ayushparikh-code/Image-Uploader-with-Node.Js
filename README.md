# Image-Uploader-with-Node.Js 🤩

### Hey!! excited CodXCrypters 😍I know that you must have scene various image uploaders on various sites on Internet

#### You could have used them to upload ur images 

#### This is a same image uploader but made using Backend-JavaScript Runtime Environment (Node.JS) 

#### I also have used a package to accomplish this

## If you are really interested to know how it works :

1. Just clone the project by clicking the Green button " Clone / Download " 
2. Open the project in V.S Code

NOTE : 

1 . For this this project firstly ,you need to have the latest version of Node.Js installed  .
          You can refer this link [👉 Here 👈](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)                                                     
2 . Secondly , you need to have the latest version of npm(node package manager of Node.Js) installed . 
          You can refer this link [👉 Here 👈](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

3. After installing these 2 , now you can easily install the other packages 

          # First, install the general node modules by doing  " npm install "
          # Secondly, install "express" module using " npm install express "
          # Third, install "multer" module using " npm install multer "
          ## We can also install these packages in one go " npm install express multer"
          # Fourth, install Nodemon , it will help you keep your server up and running " npm install nodemon "
          
4. After all these you can just go to " localhost:3001/upload " to see your project up and running.
